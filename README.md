Research Report: Life Satisfaction Determinants Analysis
**1. Summary**
This replication reproduces survey-weighted regression modeling to examine whether household income, education, religious attendance predicts self-rated life satisfaction (0–10 scale) using the 2017 General Social Survey (Cycle 31-Family).
All data were accessible via the CAnD3 course site, and the code executed without any error. The process of replication reproduced the same outputs with the authors. Results indicate all three predictor variables significantly influence life satisfaction scores.
**2. Data Description**
